# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like

It will be a square.  

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?

I could make it repeat and I could make it change direction. 

3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?

In the repeat of the square 
4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?

There is a Square in my drawing. 

5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?

The square is repeated in different sizes and how many times, and direction.
